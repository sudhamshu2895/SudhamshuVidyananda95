                                <li>How are sales and profits trending over time?</li>

                          <p>In our approach to enhance business understanding through data analysis, we begin with an indepth
EDA of the “Sample – Superstore” dataset. This step is essential to grasp the data
structure, identify key variables, and uncover initial insights, particularly focusing on sales and
profit trends, product category performance, regional analysis, and customer behavior. From
these insights, we select the most impactful Key Performance Indicators that align with the
business's objectives. Using Tableau, we then design a comprehensive dashboard, incorporating various visual elements like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts, tailored for clarity and ease of
interpretation.</p><p>Click the link below to access the files and tableau dashboard</p>

A car insurance accident prediction dataset typically contains information used to predict the likelihood of accidents or claims. This dataset might include various features such as driver demographics (age, gender), vehicle details (make, model, age), driving history (previous accidents, traffic violations), and environmental factors (road conditions, weather). The primary goal of using such a dataset is to analyze and model the risk associated with insurance policies. Insurers can use this data to tailor premiums, identify high-risk profiles, and take preemptive measures to mitigate risks. The dataset is also valuable for understanding the factors that most significantly contribute to accidents, enabling both insurers and drivers to make informed decisions.</p>

of maintenance planning decisions and assess the impact of risk, thus allowing for better decision
making under uncertainty. Monte Carlo simulations, which are commonly used to illustrate the likelihood of alternative
outcomes in a process, are utilized to do this. It's employed in situations when it's tough to predict
values owing to random factors interfering with the process. It's a technique for determining how risk
and uncertainty impact forecasting models in the long run.
Though dam building has many favourable effects on global warming, hydroelectric power
generation, climatic changes, and other factors, it has recently had numerous severe effects on the
environment and human lives. As a result, the cost and advantages of two distinct projects are
compared, and the one with the best cost-benefit ratio is chosen for execution.Analyzed financial viability for a dam construction project using Monte Carlo Simulation to accurately predict the future in terms of system or component reliability and assessed how risk and uncertainty impact forecasting models in the long run.</p>

                          <p>This study involves analyzing a large dataset of Amazon reviews through several steps. Initially, it includes data cleaning and normalization, removing stop words, and extracting key nouns to focus on relevant terms. The analysis uses topic modeling, an unsupervised learning technique, to identify common themes in the reviews. Additionally, word cloud visualizations are employed to represent the frequency and significance of terms, offering a quick view of customer sentiments. The process is iterative, with findings leading to more targeted analysis.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Qlik is a cloud-based analytical tool widely used to create interactive data visualization. In this Qlik exploration assignment, we have analyzed the Cambridge Property Database dataset. A Cambridge Property FY2016 to-FY2021 dataset captures real estate details related to property in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This dataset incorporates a wide variety of information on many properties of a real estate asset, some of them are land area, LandValue, and type and class of properties in Cambridge, the dataset even includes, book/page entry of the property, sale date, property particulars such as types and number of rooms exterior and interior materials description which facilitated us to perform various analysis. It provides valuations calculated by the Cambridge Valuation Department for each property from 2016 to 2021.</p>
                          <p>Cambridge offers one of the state's most generous housing tax exemptions. Cambridge is divided into 29 tax districts based on their geographical location.</p>
                          <p>Many research questions can be asked and answered with the Cambridge Property Database. This project answers the below two questions raised on the given dataset.
                          <ul>
                            <li>What are the top 10 Tax Districts by the tax revenue collected? What property category is contributing the highest to tax payment (residential or commercial)? What are the property types of these high contributors?</li>
                            <li>What are the top 10 Residential Property Categories in Cambridge which have high Assessed Property Value? Does their value change over the years? Is there a trend? </li>
