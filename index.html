            <h2>Interactive Dashboard for Superstore</h2>
            <p>The primary challenge for the ‘Sample – Superstore’ business is to gain a deeper understanding
of its operational performance across various dimensions such as sales, profits, customer
segments, product categories, and geographical regions. The business needs to identify which
areas are excelling and which require strategic adjustments. Key questions include:
• How are sales and profits trending over time?
• Which product categories and sub-categories are the most profitable?
• What are the sales and profit trends across different regions?
• How is the business performing in terms of customer acquisition and retention?. I have used Tableau, Python to come up with an interactive dashboard.</p>
